  **Your users should be able to:**

  ### **Where to find everything**

  - Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 
  - The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 
  - If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).
  - You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
  - There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
